      abstract = {Paneling an architectural freeform surface refers to an  approximation of the de- sign surface by a set of panels  that can be manufactured using a selected technology at a  reasonable cost, while respecting the design intent and  achieving the desired aesthetic quality of panel layout and  surface smoothness. Eigensatz and co-workers have recently  introduced a computational solution to the paneling problem  that allows handling large-scale freeform surfaces  involving complex arrangements of thousands of panels. We  extend this paneling algorithm to facilitate effective  design exploration, in particular for local control of  tolerance margins and the handling of sharp crease lines.  We focus on the practical aspects relevant for the  realization of large-scale freeform designs and evaluate  the performance of the paneling algorithm with a number of  case studies.},
