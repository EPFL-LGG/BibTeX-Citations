abstract = {Image and geometry registration algorithms are essential components of many computer graphics and computer vision systems. With recent technological advances in RGB-D sensors, robust algorithms that combine 2D image and 3D geometry registration have become an active area of research.This course introduces the basics of 2D/3D registration algorithms and provides theoretical explanations and practical tools for designing computer vision and computer graphics systems based on RGB-D devices such as the Microsoft Kinect or Asus Xtion Live. To illustrate the theory and demonstrate practical relevance, the course briefly discusses three applications: rigid scanning, non-rigid modeling, and real-time face tracking.},
