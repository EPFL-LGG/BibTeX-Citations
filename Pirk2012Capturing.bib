  abstract={Caustics are captivating light patterns created by materials bundling
or diverting light by refraction or reflection. We know caustics as random side
effects, appearing, for example, at the bottom of a swimming pool. In this paper
we show that it is possible to control caustic patterns to form almost any desired
shape by optimizing the geometry of the reflective or refractive surface generating
the caustic. We demonstrate how this surprising result offers a new perspective on
light control and the use of caustics as an inspiring architectural design element.
Several produced prototypes illustrate that physical realizations of such optimized
geometry are feasible.}
