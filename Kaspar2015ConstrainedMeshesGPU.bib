abstract={Constrained meshes play an important role in free-form architectural design, as they can represent panel layouts on free-form surfaces. It is challenging to perform real-time manipulation on such meshes, because all constraints need to be respected during the deformation while the shape quality needs to be maintained. This usually leads to nonlinear constrained optimization problems, which are challenging to solve in real time. In this chapter, we present a GPU-based shape manipulation tool for constrained meshes, using the parallelizable algorithm proposed in Deng et al. (Computer-Aided Design, 2014). We discuss the main challenges and solutions for the GPU implementation and provide timing comparison against CPU implementations of the algorithm. Our GPU implementation significantly outperforms the CPU version, allowing real-time handle-based deformation for large constrained meshes.}
