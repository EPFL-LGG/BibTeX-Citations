abstract={Fabrication of LEGO models in large scale requires careful pre-planning to produce constructable and stable
models. We propose a system that, starting with a voxelization of a 3D mesh, merges voxels to form larger bricks,
and then analyzes and repairs structural problems, finally outputting a set of building instructions. We also present
extensions such as producing hollow models, fulfilling limits on the number of bricks of each size, and including
colors. Results (both real and virtual) and timings show significant improvements over previous work.}
