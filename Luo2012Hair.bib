  abstract={Reconstructing realistic 3D hair geometry is challenging
due to omnipresent occlusions, complex discontinuities
and specular appearance. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view hair reconstruction algorithm based
on orientation fields with structure-aware aggregation. Our
key insight is that while hairâ€™s color appearance is viewdependent,
the response to oriented filters that captures
the local hair orientation is more stable. We apply the
structure-aware aggregation to the MRF matching energy
to enforce the structural continuities implied from the local
hair orientations. Multiple depth maps from the MRF optimization
are then fused into a globally consistent hair geometry
with a template refinement procedure. Compared to
the state-of-the-art color-based methods, our method faithfully
reconstructs detailed hair structures. We demonstrate
the results for a number of hair styles, ranging from straight
to curly, and show that our framework is suitable for capturing
hair in motion.}
