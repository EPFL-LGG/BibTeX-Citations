abstract={The concept of symmetry has received significant attention in computer graphics and computer vision research in
recent years. Numerous methods have been proposed to find, extract, encode, and exploit geometric symmetries
and high-level structural information for a wide variety of geometry processing tasks. This report surveys and
classifies recent developments in symmetry detection. We focus on elucidating the key similarities and differences
between existing methods to gain a better understanding of a fundamental problem in digital geometry processing
and shape understanding in general. We discuss a variety of applications in computer graphics and geometry
processing that benefit from symmetry information for more effective processing. An analysis of the strengths and
limitations of existing algorithms highlights the plenitude of opportunities for future research both in terms of
theory and applications.}
